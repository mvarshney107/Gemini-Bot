Gemini Bot for Discord

This bot can be activated by using @ mentions. To keep context, reply directly to the bot's messages. Context is reset when @ mentioned again or conversation reaches limit of 6 messages (this exceeds the gemini flash input size).

For the full working bot, use the full-bot.py file. The experimental.py file is mainly used to test things that may break functionality, so it might not run as expected.
